We have been provided a data simulator. The simulator writes 3 records per second into a table in PostgresSQL called devices.

<h2> Task: Data ETL </h2>
The data generated above needs to be pulled, transformed and saved into a new database environment. Create an ETL pipeline that does the following:

* Pull the data from PostgresSQL
* Calculate the following data aggregations:<br>
a. The maximum temperatures measured for every device per hours.<br>
b. The amount of data points aggregated for every device per hours.<br>
c. Total distance of device movement for every device per hours.
* Store this aggregated data into the provided MySQL database
